## Overview 

This technical writing and editing project is part of your interview. It is designed to take between 1.5 - 2 hours.

## Instructions

Imagine that a member of your team has published this [sample text](terraform-getting-started.md). Create a new repository containing the sample text, and open a PR to improve the content, correct the educational and technical errors, and implement the provided [writing style guide](../styling-guide-snippet.md) and [guide template](../guide-template.md). You may link to existing resources created by HashiCorp or the community, but do not plagiarize content from HashiCorp tutorials or documentation. 

**NOTE: Do not fork this repository.** Make a copy of all files, and create a fresh repository. This will prevent other candidates from easily finding your work.

To complete the assignment:

1. Create a new, public GitHub repository (do not fork this repository). Make sure the repository is publicly accessible so we can review your submission.
1. Before editing, commit [the initial version of the sample text](terraform-getting-started.md) to the main branch of the repository. 
1. Create a new branch and update the sample text to satisfy the style guide.
1. Create a pull request for your proposed changes to the text. Do not merge the pull request.

When editing:

- Add learning objectives to the introduction.
- Add additional sections and content for both prerequisites and next steps. 
- Add section titles that are compatible with the guide template.
- Identify and fix any spelling or grammar mistakes.
- Edit the text for readability and compatibility with the style guide.
- Run the code and paste the terminal output for all commands. 

Once you have completed the assignment, send a link to your PR to the recruiter.
