## Overview 

This technical writing and editing project is part of your interview. It is designed to take between 1.5 - 2 hours.

Please take the time to carefully review the [writing style guide](../styling-guide-snippet.md) and the [guide template](../guide-template.md) before getting started.

## Instructions


Update the [sample text](terraform-getting-started.md) to follow the provided [writing style guide](../styling-guide-snippet.md) and
[guide template](../guide-template.md).

**Any changes that you think will improve the text and explain the concepts better are welcome**. If anything in the text does not match your opinion on a best practice, feel free to correct the meaning of the text. You may link to existing resources created by HashiCorp or the community, but do not plagiarize content from HashiCorp tutorials or documentation. 

To complete the assignment:
- Create a new, public GitHub repository for your submission (do not fork this repository). Make sure the repository is publicly accessible so we can review your submission.
- Before editing, commit [the initial version of the sample text](terraform-getting-started.md) to the main branch of the repository. 
- Create a new branch and update the sample text to satisfy the style guide.
- Create a pull request for your proposed changes to the text. Do not merge the pull request.

**NOTE: DO NOT FORK THE PROJECT.** Make a copy of all files, create a fresh repository, and open a pull request against your own project.

When editing:
- Identify and fix any spelling or grammar mistakes.
- Edit the text for readability and compatibility with the style guide.
- Run the code and paste the terminal output in Markdown for all commands. 
- Add section titles that are compatible with the guide template.
- Add learning objectives to the introduction.
- Add additional sections and content for both prerequisites and next steps. 

### Assumptions: 
- The audience has none to minimal experience with Terraform.

Once you have completed the assignment, send a link to your PR to the HashiCorp recruiter.
