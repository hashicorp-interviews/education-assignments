## Overview 

As a manager of product education engineering, you are accountable for content quality, which involves reviewing and providing clear feedback on your team's work. So, this technical writing and editing project is part of your interview. It is designed to take between 1.5 - 2 hours.

## Instructions

Imagine that a member of your team has published this [sample text](terraform-getting-started.md). Create a new repository containing the sample text. Then open a PR to give your team member feedback, improve the content, correct the educational and technical errors, and implement the provided [writing style guide](../styling-guide-snippet.md) and [guide template](../guide-template.md). You may link to existing resources created by HashiCorp or the community, but do not plagiarize content from HashiCorp tutorials or documentation. 

**NOTE: Do not branch or fork this repository.** Make a copy of all files, and create a fresh repository. This will prevent other candidates from easily finding your work.

To complete the assignment:

1. Create a new, public GitHub repository (do not fork this repository). Make sure the repository is publicly accessible so we can review your submission.
1. Before editing, commit [the initial version of the sample text](terraform-getting-started.md) to the main branch of the repository. 
1. Create a new branch and update the sample text with your improvements.
1. Open a pull request with your proposed changes and include any feedback for the author.
1. Do not merge the pull request.

When editing:

- Add learning objectives to the introduction.
- Run the code and paste the terminal output for all commands. 
- Identify and fix any spelling or grammar mistakes.
- Edit the text for readability and compatibility with the style guide and template.
- Make any other improvements that you think will make the content better. 

Once you have completed the assignment, send a link to your PR to the recruiter.
